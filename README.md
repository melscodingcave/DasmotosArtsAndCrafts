# 🎨 Dasmoto’s Arts & Crafts — Semantic HTML Recreation

A front-end exercise recreating the *Dasmoto’s Arts & Crafts* website based on a provided design document.  
Originally a **Codecademy HTML project**, the goal was to match the layout and styling.  
Instead of relying heavily on `<div>` tags (as suggested in the exercise), this version uses **semantic HTML elements** for a cleaner and more accessible structure.

## 💡 Overview

The challenge: recreate a webpage layout from a style/design spec.

What makes this version different?  
While many beginner examples use non-semantic wrappers, this version uses proper tags like:

- `<header>`
- `<section>`
- `<article>`
- `<main>`
- `<footer>`

This results in better document structure, improved readability, and more accessible content.
